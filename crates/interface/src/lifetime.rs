//! Lifetime management for the Unrealscript debugger interface.
//!
//! This module contains functions and data structures related to maintaining
//! state outside of Unreal for the lifetime of a debugging session.
//!
//! The debug adapter DLL's lifetime is entirely controlled by Unreal. The
//! DLL is loaded when a debugging session starts, and is unloaded when the
//! debugging session ends. This is a total unload and the DLL is unmapped from
//! memory entirely, so we need to be careful to allow for graceful shutdown
//! when the debugging session is ending. This is made more difficult because
//! Unreal doesn't actually directly tell us when this is going to happen,
//! we can only infer it.
//!
//! A debugging session can start in two ways:
//!
//! - When the game is launched with -autoDebug. The debugger interface is then
//! loaded as part of game startup and we receive a normal init sequence and then
//! unreal will automatically break at the first opportunity.
//!
//! - When the user enters a '\toggledebugger' command. The debugger interface
//! is loaded and we receive an init sequence, but Unreal does not break.
//!
//! The debugging session can end in three ways:
//!
//! - When the user quits the game while a debugging session is active.
//! - When the user enters the '\toggledebugger' command while a debugging
//! session is active.
//! - When the 'stopdebugging' command is sent to Unreal.
//!
//! The first two cases are the same, the last is slightly different because
//! the command originates inside the debugger interface. But all three perform
//! the same shutdown sequence and then unload the DLL from memory. We must be
//! _very_ careful to ensure this happens cleanly, as any lingering code that
//! tries to run after the DLL is unloaded will almost certainly cause a crash.
//!
//! The 'initialize' function is used to set up the debugger state when we are
//! starting a debugging session.
